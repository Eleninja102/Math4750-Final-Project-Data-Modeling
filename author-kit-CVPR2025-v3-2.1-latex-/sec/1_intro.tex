\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
This project aimed to develop a random forest model for classification. This model was trained to predict arrests in Chicago based on crime data from 2022. By analyzing a variety of factors such as the type of crime, time of day, location, and other associated features, the model classifies whether an arrest is likely to occur. This predictive tool could assist law enforcement agencies by improving resource allocation, enhancing operational efficiency, and as an informing decision-making process regarding crime prevention.
